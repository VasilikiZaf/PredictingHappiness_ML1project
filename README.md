# MachineLearning1_FinalProject

This project aims to train classification algorithms using multiple sklearn machine learning models, in order to predict how happy countries are around the world. The data for this task come from the WorldHappinessReport on Kaggle, and are a collection of happiness scores per country based on an array of features.

This project was done in the context of the course "Machine Learning I", during the Master of Digital Text Analysis offered by the University of Antwerp. In this repository, you will find the datasets used, the Python notebook with all the implemented models and a short report describing the models performance.

The algorithms I used were:

1.   Perceptron
2.   Logistic Regression
3.   KNN classifier
4.   Decision Tree Classifier
5.   SVM Classifier
6.   SGD Classifier
